[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/contao-community-alliance/events-contao-bindings.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/contao-community-alliance/events-contao-bindings)

This library turns the Contao Core API into events.

Known limitations:
------------------

* We have no manual so far. Bummer! :/
* We have not tested it all yet, so please give it a try yourself.
